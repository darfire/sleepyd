# sleepyd, a sleepd replacement

sleepyd is a replacement for sleepd which is no maintained and is is missing from the Ubuntu repositories. It listens to mouse and keyboard events. Optionally, it can check whether established connections to certain local ports (think SSH) exist, in which case it doesn't sleep.
